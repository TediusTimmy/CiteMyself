      This is a wrapper for the STL stack, as I don't like
      its default behavior when asked for top() of an empty
      stack: undefined. The STL stack also has undefined
      behavior when asked to pop an empty stack.

      This also wraps up the stack-based round mode.

      With the exception of the added round mode data,
      this is a drop-in replacement for the STL stack.
