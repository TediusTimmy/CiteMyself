      This was originally for a semester project in a C++ programming class.

      It wasn't necessary for the project to be this complex, however, I
      was only taking the class for credit, and the project was on my mind.

      This is based on an inferior calculator I wrote in Java, for the purpose
      of showing myself that I could program in Java, and that calculator
      helped speed the completion of this one.

      Pros and cons: In Java, I didn't have to worry about memory
      deallocation. I mitigated this in C++ with the Column class,
      that probably generates alot more memory copying than the Java version.
      I have operator overloading in C++, which makes complex calculations
      in the functions easier to look at. The Java version, if ported directly
      into C++, would be faster, however, as the layers of functions allowed
      me to jump past some bounds checks when I knew they were unnecessary.
